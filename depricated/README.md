the depricated folder is for any files that would be nice to keep for reference, but aren't/shouldn't be used in the actual project.

When adding js files  to this foler, please add the following to display as soon as the file loads:
alert("ATTN: THIS FILE IS DEPRICATED. YOU SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE HERE");
